Facebook Image Graph Search
===========================

Due to the advent of Post Search , it's difficult to use the feature of "Photos of" which was earlier done using 
graph search . This application helps to ease the problem. Though you need to open the terminal which is not an 
issue for me since it's opened always :P :P 

Extension 1 :
-------------

The profile picture of a given username is also opened in a new tab with original (maximum) size. 

Preconditions :
---------------

Graph search doesn't work until you are logged into your account while the extension works otherwise also.

Usage : 
------

* Run `python main.py`
* Enter Username
* The page will be opened in new tab

Requirements :
--------------

* Python 2.7
